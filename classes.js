/* 
We have a school to build here! In this project you will get used to thinking about classes in JavaScript and building them from a brand new data set.
*/

/* 
Person
 - First we need a Person class. This will be our base-class
 - Person receives name age location all as props
 - Person receives speak as a method.
    - This method returns a phrase Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock where name and location are the object's own props

Professor
 - Now that we have a Person as our base class, we'll build our Professor class.
 - Professor uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
 - Professor has the following unique props:
     - subject what the Professor is good at i.e. 'Kanye West and his impact on modern hip-hop'
     - catchPhrase i.e. Don't forget the homies
 - Professor has the following methods:
     - greet returns the Professor's own catch-phrase
